Welcome to my website on the Computer Science Department!
The Computer Science department website serves as a vital platform for various stakeholders, including students, faculty, researchers, prospective applicants, and the broader community. Here's an insight into the key functionalities and content typically found on my Computer Science department website:

Course Catalog: A comprehensive list of courses available, along with descriptions, prerequisites, and schedules.

Staff Information: Details about administrative and support staff within the department.

Departmental News: Updates, announcements, achievements, and noteworthy events within the department.

Contact Details: Clear and accessible information about the department's address, phone numbers, and email contacts.

About: where clear information on the mission vision and values of the department is said.

History: the departmental history is shared to acknowledge years of service to students and faculty members

Blogs: more engaging weebsite for departmental members
