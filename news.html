    </p>Here are some recent news highlights:
    Focus on 21st Century Skills: A Pew survey of six African countries found that internet usage is high among youth, which is good news for schools as it will help them teach 21st-century skills such as digital literacy, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This is crucial for Africa, where 60% of the population is under age 25
    
    Youth Engagement in Computer Science: There are examples of initiatives promoting computer science education in Africa. For instance, the Ghana Code Club has trained more than 1,700 students and 300 teachers, while Teencoders in Nigeria has reached over 5,000 students through coding classes
    
    Supercomputing Advancements: Morocco's Mohammed VI Polytechnic University has launched Africa's most powerful supercomputer center, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, Dell, and Intel. This supercomputer aims to support vital research in Africa on topics such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, genomics, food security, agriculture, and mining
    
    AI for Social Impact: African software developers are using AI to fight inequality. For example, South African computer scientist Raesetje Sefala is building algorithms to flag poverty hotspots, with the hope of targeting aid, new housing, or clinics. This reflects a growing trend of using AI to address Africa's specific challenges

    Demand for Computer Scientists: The demand for computer science professionals is growing in Africa, with fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning shaping how businesses operate in the future. However, there is still a talent deficit in South Africa, highlighting the need for more computer scientists in the region

    These developments underscore the increasing importance of computer science education and technological advancements in Africa, particularly in addressing local challenges and preparing the youth for the future.
